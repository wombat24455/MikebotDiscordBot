# MikeBot

MikeBot is a "multipurpose" discord bot which has a mix of fun features and "administration features". Although MikeBot doesn't have many features at the moment you can still invite the bot through the [website](https://wombat24455.github.io/mikebot.github.io/) or [directly](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=639421464185143301&scope=bot&permissions=2146958847). The bot is being developed by the bot developers: wombat24455, techman471, Jacket-Chan, ~Cwavs~ and Crazy Teacup. Cwavs has decided to step down from his position.
