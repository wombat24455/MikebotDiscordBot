# Contributing to MikeBot's development
If you wanna contribute to the development of [MikeBot](https://github.com/wombat24455/MikebotDiscordBot) read the stuff below I guess lol.

## Code of conduct
Read the stuff about Code of Conduct [here](https://github.com/wombat24455/MikebotDiscordBot/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you want to report abuse or inappropriate behaviour shoot an email to Mikeb0tsupp0rt@gmail.com and I'll reply as soon as possible. (no spam emails pls :C )

## Want something to be added to MikeBot?
Well you've come to the right place... to be told to go create an [issue](https://github.com/wombat24455/MikebotDiscordBot/issues) or use the **>$suggest** command, either way I will take a look at your requests.

## Spotted an issue with MikeBot?
If you've spotted an issue with MikeBot (command abuse etc) create an [issue](https://github.com/wombat24455/MikebotDiscordBot/issues) (again lol) ~~I will be creating a command similar to the **>$suggest** command which will be sent to the MikeBot discord server (not public yet)~~ or you can report the bug using the command **>$reportbug**.
